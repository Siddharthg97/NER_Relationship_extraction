The objective of the game is to score goals by shooting a rubber puck into the opposing team's net using a long, curved stick called a hockey stick.\\n\\nThe game is divided into three periods of twenty minutes each, with a fifteen-minute intermission between the second and third periods. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins. If the game is tied after the three periods, it goes into overtime, where the first team to score wins.\\n\\nHockey is known for its physicality, with players frequently checking their opponents to gain possession of the puck. Checking involves using the body to knock opponents off balance or to the ground. Body contact is an essential part of the game, but excessive force or dangerous hits can result in penalties.\\n\\nHockey requires a high level of fitness and agility, as players must skate constantly and change direction quickly to keep up with the game's fast pace.
